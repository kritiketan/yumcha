### Story

Yumcha is a chinese tradition involving tea and snacks (usually dimsum).
  The western world equivalent of a coffee break.
  When life was not just a bridge from one lockdown to another,
  I for one used to enjoy coffee breaks with colleagues a LOT.
  Those breaks now involve, browsing through deep recesses of the internet
  which in most cases are useless.
  So here are some of the most useless websites for your coffee (Productivity) breaks
